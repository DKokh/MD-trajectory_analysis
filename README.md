This open source software code was developed in part in the Human Brain Project, funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under Specific Grant Agreements  No. 785907 (Human Brain Project  SGA2).

    Packages required:
    Python 3.x
    numpy;    pandas;  matplotlib;  MDAnalysis;  RDkit;   scipy
    code is written on Python 3.x and tested on Python 3.7
    to configure envirement in anaconda use
    conda env create -f IFP_trajectory.yml



1. Scripts:

    Clustering.py   - containes functions for analysis of trajectories using IFP data   
    IFP_generation.py  - contains functions for generation of IFPs
    Membrane_analysis.py
    Trajectories.py  - contains functions for building a trajectory object for reading and analysis standard MD and RAMD trajectories and computation of relative residence times

2. Data:

        2YKI
        4MQT
        6EI5
        
3. Example jupyter notebooks :

         (i)jupyter notebook IFP_generation_examples_PDB.ipynb: an examples of Protein-Ligand IFP computations
        Computing interaction fingerprints (IFP) for
        --- a single structure prepared for MD simulations (HSP90; PDB ID 6EI5, dcd format)
        --- a trajectory (for selected frames; dcd format)
        --- a PDB structure

        (ii)jupyter notebook IFP_generation_example_TRAJ.ipynb: example of generation and analysis of Ligand-Protein IFPs for RAMD simulations (dcd trajectories)
        Computing interaction fingerprints (IFP) for
        --- system equilibration trajectory
        --- ligand dissociation trajectories
