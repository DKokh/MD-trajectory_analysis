This open source software code was developed in part in the Human Brain Project, funded from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Framework Programme for Research and Innovation under Specific Grant Agreements  No. 785907 (Human Brain Project  SGA2).


Packages required:
    numpy;    pandas;  matplotlib;  MDAnalysis;  RDkit;   scipy
    code is written on Python 3.x and tested on Python 3.7
   
    to configure envirement in anaconda use
    conda env create -f IFP_trajectory.yml


Scripts:

1. Trajectories.py 	- analysis of protein-ligand dissociation pathways
2. Membrane_analysis.py - analysis of the membrane properties
3. IFP_generation.py  	- generation of Protein-Ligand Interaction Fingerprints  (PL IFP)


Examples:
1. Example jupyter notebooks : 

  (i)IFP_generation_examples_PDB.ipynb
   Test examples of PL IFP computations
   1. Computing interaction fingerprints (IFP) for
     -- a single structure prepared for MD simulations (HSP90; PDB ID 6EI5, dcd format)
     -- a trajectory (for selected frames; dcd format)
     -- PDB structure
   2. Visualizing protein residues that are involved in protein-ligand interactions, including water-bridges
