## __Packages requirements:__
__Python 3.x__

__Python Libraries:__ numpy;    pandas;  matplotlib;  MDAnalysis;  seaborn; RDkit; sklearn;  scipy; ngview 

__Chimera__ - only for the scripts used for preprocessing pdb files (structure protonation and generation of the ligand mol2 file); not required if protonation and mol2 file are already prepared by a user)
    
__Codes were written on Python 3.x and tested on Python 3.7__

__To configure envirement in anaconda use:__
conda env create -f IFP_trajectory.yml


#__Important Notes regarding IFP computations:__

  1. __Ligand structure preparation__
      - Ideally ligand structure should be provided by MOL2 file. However, not all MOL2 formats are accepted by RDKit (Python library that is used to determine ligand atom  properties). The best way to generate mol2 file is to use MOE or Maestro software. Generated mol2 file in same cases can also be corrected by http://www.swissparam.ch/. The main problem with Chimera is that correctly describes bonds in aromatic or cyclic groubs containing nitrogen atoms
      - If mol2 file is absent or is not accepted by RDKit, pdb file will be used to define properies of ligand atoms. Unfortunately, in this case aromatic fragments will not be identified.
      - There are several atom properties that are introduced in addition to those identified by RDKit:
          (i) Hydrophobic properties of fluorine atoms
          (ii) Neg. ionazable property of the phosphate atom
          (iii) Acceptor property of the oxigen atoms bound to phosphate atoms
      - __Important__, that the name of the ligand in mol2 file (or the residue name in the pdb file if mol2 is absent) is used to detect ligand in a trajectory or in a complex. If the residue name is different - IFP will not be computed!
