#  This is a collection of example recipes showing how to carry out particular tasks using MD-IFP scripts


##  Generation of the Interaction Fingerprint table for a set of MD trajectories obtained either from standard MD simulations or RAMD simulations
Most steps included in the present examples are also demonstrated in the JN IFP_generation_examples_TRAJ.ipynb
However, to analyze a large set of trajectories a simple python script is usually more useful.

This example provide a template script that, after small adjastment, can be used to generate IFPs for: 
- a single MD trajectory    
- a set of MD trajectories. 
- a set of Equilibration MD trajectories and dissociation RAMD trajectries
    
    
    
All steps are also included in IFP.py, that can be adjasted for a particualr task

1. **Prerequisite:**
    - Python 3.X and a set of python libraries
        Alteratively, one can configure environment in anaconda using: conda env create -f IFP_trajectory.yml
    - Scripts directory containing Scripts/IFP_generation.py and Scripts/Trajectories.py 
    
2.** Input data required:**
    - trajectory file (possible formats: nc,dcd, xtc, trr )
    - pdb file of the system (for example, generated from the first frame)
    - ligand pdb file
    - ligand mol2 file (not all mol2 files can be read, files generated by MOEor Maestro are fine)
         
3. **Procedure (all steps are also combined in the IFP.py script that can be adapted for a particular task )**
 
    (i) _working directory and template of trajectory names that will be searched and added to the object are defined._
        for example, simulated equilibration and dissociation trajectories can be stored as follows:
        for equilibration:
        
        my_ligand/my_equilibration/my_replica1/md1.dcd
        my_ligand/my_equilibration/my_replica2/md2.dcd
        
        for dissociation:
        
        my_ligand/my_RAMD/my_replica1/my_trajectory1/md1.dcd
        my_ligand/my_RAMD/my_replica1/my_trajectory2/md2.dcd
        
        my_ligand/my_RAMD/my_replica2/my_trajectory1/md1.dcd
        my_ligand/my_RAMD/my_replica2/my_trajectory2/md2.dcd
        
        reference pdb file for teh system: 
        
        my_ligand/topology/my_ref.pdb
        
        mol2 and pdb files for the ligand:

        my_ligand/topology/my_ligand.pdb
        my_ligand/topology/my_ligand.mol2
  
    In this case we define input parameters as following:
    
    __________________________________
    
        DIR_all = "my_ligand/"
        eq = "my_equilibration/my_replic*"
        ramd = "my_RAMD/my_replic*"
        eq_tr ="my_trajec*/*.dcd"
        ramd_tr = "my_trajec*/*.dcd"
     __________________________________
     
     Note, that the reference pdb file for a complete system  and pdb/mol2 for a ligand are obligatory, while equilibration or RAMD trajectory can be omitted
   
    (ii)_Trajectory object is generated_, 
    
    which contains all information of equilibration and RAMD trajectories. 
    Additionally, ligand structure and chemical properties will be analized
    
     __________________________________
     
        tr = trajectories(DIR_all,namd_tmpl= eq, ramd_tmpl= ramd,ligand_pdb=lig_pdb,pdb = ref_pdb,\
                          ligand_mol2=lig_mol2,namd_traj_tmpl = eq_tr,ramd_traj_tmpl = tamd_tr)                   
      __________________________________
      
     (iii) Defenition of a sub-system to be analyzed 
        several possibilities are shown below. 
        Ligand will be added automatically to any chosen sub-system; 
        by default only protein will be considered as a sub-system 
        Inclusion water makes simulations notably (at least several times) slower
     __________________________________
                               
        tr.sub_system = " protein  "                                              # only protein and ligand - default set
        tr.sub_system = " protein or (resname SOL HOH WAT G G3 G5 U5 C C3 MN)  "  # protein, ligand, solvent, RNA residues, and Mn ion
        tr.sub_system = " protein or (resname SOL HOH WAT )  "                    # protein, ligand, solvent,

     (iv) IFP generation           
       (a) for equilibration trajectories: 
        - One can define if water bridges must be computed (WB_analysis = True/False, default-False). 
          For computation of water bridges  water must be included in the sub-system in the previous step
        - Contact with lipd can be computed - lipid residue names are defined as a list, for example: Lipids = ["PC","CHL","PA"]
        - fiest frame and stride are defined by the parameters step_analysis and start_analysis
          Saving results  in a data frame file (pkl)         
        - as an input parameter file name should be given  
     __________________________________
     
        tr.analysis_all_namd(WB_analysis = False, Lipids = [],auxi_selection = [],step_analysis=step, start_analysis=start)  
        IFP_table = tr.namd.IFP_save(file_name)
      _________________________________
     
      (b) for RAMD trajectories first relative residence times are computed:
            parameters are the same 
     __________________________________   

        tr.ramd.scan_ramd()
        tr.analysis_all_ramd(WB_analysis = False, Lipids = [],auxi_selection = [],step_analysis=step, start_analysis=start)
        IFP_table = tr.namd.IFP_save(file_name)
